# Getting started with SwiftPM Snippets

[SwiftPM Snippets](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0356-swift-snippets.md) are one of the most powerful features of the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager), and yet two years after their introduction almost no one knows they exist. This tutorial will explain some of the advantages of using SwiftPM Snippets and show you how to add Snippets to a Swift package, preview them in documentation locally using [DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc), render them in [Unidoc](https://github.com/tayloraswift/swift-unidoc), and publish them on your own website or a centralized platform like [Swiftinit](https://swiftinit.org) where readers can view their code and interact with the symbols contained within them.


## What are Swift Snippets?

Swift Snippets were invented in 2022 by [Ashley Garland](https://github.com/bitjammer) and first shipped in Swift 5.7. [Originally conceived](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0356-swift-snippets/57097) as a way to validate example programs by compiling them, developers have since found a variety of additional applications for them, ranging from testing to documentation to even full-blown prototyping of multi-module setups.

Despite their immense potential, very little documentation exists on how to use Swift Snippets, and awareness of the feature remains [surprisingly low](https://github.com/search?q=%40Snippet+language%3Aswift&type=code).

> The outlook for this feature is pessimistic considering the low adoption rate. This might change if Apple invests in better documentation and adopts Snippets in their own repositories.

## Why use Swift Snippets?

Swift Snippets are incredibly versatile. Some common applications include:

-   **Scratch modules**. Snippets are effectively single-file Swift modules, and can be used to quickly prototype code or sketch patterns without the overhead of declaring a proper library target in the package manifest. Snippets are especially useful when the code being prototyped depends on other modules, as Snippets have the ability to `import` modules available to the normal targets in the package.

-   **Reproductions**. Snippets can be used to reproduce bugs in a minimal environment, with little to no setup required. Although you could also compile your own playgrounds manually with `swiftc -parse-as-library`, it is much easier to run Snippets because they are automatically discovered by the `swift run` command.

    Snippets are especially useful for reproducing compiler bugs. Some developers find it helpful to keep a `.gitignore`â€™d `Snippets/Crashes` directory in their local environment specifically for collecting compiler crashes.

-   **Examples**. Snippets can be used to provide runnable examples that ship with your package. This allows you to avoid cluttering the package manifest with example targets, and helps you organize your examples in a self-documenting manner.

-   **Documentation**. Snippets can be embedded in Markdown documentation and displayed in DocC. This allows you to include live code examples in your documentation that are guaranteed to compile and run.

    Snippets can be sliced and embedded as individual code fragments, allowing you to write tutorials that discuss each section of an example program in detail.

    Some documentation backends such as Unidoc can render Snippets in the browser with linked identifiers, allowing readers to interact with the symbols in the code.


## Adding Snippets to a Swift package

For this tutorial, we will create a package named `snippets-example`.

```bash
$ mkdir snippets-example
$ cd snippets-example
$ swift package init --name 'Swift Snippets'
```

This should initialize a new Swift package with a `Package.swift` resembling the following.

@Code(name: "Package.swift", file: Manifest.1.swift)

Rename the library target to `Snippets Example`.

@Code(name: "Package.swift", file: Manifest.2.swift)

Next, create a new directory named `Snippets` at the top level of the package.

```bash
$ mkdir Snippets
```

>   Note: Despite the specification of [SE-0356](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0356-swift-snippets.md#overriding-the-location-of-snippets), it is not possible to name the directory anything other than `Snippets`.

Inside the `Snippets` directory, create a new Swift file named `I.swift`.

@Snippet(id: "I")

You should now have a directory structure that looks like this:

```
ðŸ“‚ swift-snippets
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Snippets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ I.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Sources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Snippets Example
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ anchor.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ Package.swift
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ .gitignore
```

Thatâ€™s it!


## Running Snippets

The `swift build` command will automatically discover and compile all Snippets in a package.

Snippets are just modules with discovery enabled, which means you can also build a single Snippet with the `--target` flag.

```bash
$ swift build --target I
```

You can run a Snippet with the `swift run` command.

```bash
$ swift run I
```

```text
Building for debugging...
[5/5] Linking I
Build complete! (0.97s)
Hi Barbie!
```

You could also run a Snippet with release optimizations, just like any other executable target.

```bash
$ swift run -c release I
```

```text
Building for production...
[17/17] Linking I
Build complete! (9.73s)
Hi Barbie!
```

>   Note:
>   If the Snippet name contains special characters, you should pass the file name as-is to the `--target` flag. For example, to run a Snippet named `Foo bar.swift`, you would use `swift run 'Foo bar'` and not `Foo_bar`.


## Embedding Snippets in documentation

Most modern documentation engines support embedding Snippets in Markdown documentation via the `@Snippet` block directive.

Letâ€™s create a documentation bundle for the `Snippets Example` target.

```bash
$ mkdir -p Sources/Snippets\ Example/docs.docc
```

>   Tip:
>   You can name the documentation bundle anything you like, as long as it has a `.docc` extension. The name comes from the DocC tool, but most other documentation engines will recognize it too.

Create a markdown article named `My article.md` in the `docs.docc` directory.

@Code(name: "My article.md", file: "My article (1).md.txt")

If the Snippet ID contains special characters, you should pass the ID as-is, without replacing any characters.

You should now have a project layout that looks like this:

```
ðŸ“‚ swift-snippets
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Snippets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ I.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Sources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Snippets Example
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ docs.docc
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ My article.md
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ anchor.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ Package.swift
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ .gitignore
```


### Previewing Snippets with DocC

Many developers find [DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc) helpful for previewing documentation locally.

To use DocC, add the [swift-docc-plugin](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-plugin) to the package manifest.

@Code(name: "Package.swift", file: Manifest.3.swift)

>   Important:
>   DocC does not currently support referencing Snippets by ID. Instead, you must use the fully-qualified `path` syntax to reference a Snippet.
>
>   Despite its naming, the `path` syntax is not a file path. The first component is the name of the package **as specified by the ``PackageDescription/Package/name`` field in the manifest**. The second component is always the string `Snippets`. The third component is the name of the Snippet file without the `.swift` extension.

@Code(name: "My article.md", file: "My article (2).md.txt")


## Using Snippet captions



## Embedding slices

You can divide a Snippet into slices using slice directives. A slice directive is a comment that starts with `// snippet` followed by a dot and an identifier.

@Snippet(id: II)
