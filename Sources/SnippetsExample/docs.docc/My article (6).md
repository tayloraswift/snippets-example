# My article

This is a simple article that demonstrates how to embed a Snippet with named slices.

@Snippet(path: "Swift Snippets/Snippets/V", slice: DECLARATION)
@Snippet(path: "Swift Snippets/Snippets/V", slice: BODY)
@Snippet(path: "Swift Snippets/Snippets/V", slice: EXIT)

If you do not specify a slice, all slices will be included in the article.

@Snippet(path: "Swift Snippets/Snippets/V")
